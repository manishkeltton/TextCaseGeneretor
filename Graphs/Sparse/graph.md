<h1>Usage Details</h1>

<h3>Variable used</h3>
1. lim_n 		= 		maximum number of vertices in graph desired

<h3>Lines to be modified</h3>
* If you do not want the number of test cases in file, comment line number 121
* To set the number of test cases for the file, set the variable "test_cases" to desired value on line number 119
* To change the limit on mamimum size of graph, change variable "lim_n" on line number 8
* To make the number of vertices of the graph to a fixed value, set variable "n" to the value desired on line number 126
* To make the number of edges of the graph to a fixed value, set variable "m" to the value desired on line number 127. (Remember the graph is connected. So, m >= (n-1).)
